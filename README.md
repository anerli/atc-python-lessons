# ATC  Python Lessons

Hello there!

This is a repository for Python lessons. It was created for the Algorithmic Trading Club at ISU. Some examples are targeted towards financial / trading concepts to make the learning more revelevant to club content. The lessons start very general and progressively get more specific towards algorithmic trading concepts.

This is by no means a fully comprehensive guide to Python. Given that weekly club meetings are only so long and this material is taught during those meetings, this aims to be an outline to the most important Python concepts. For more thorough information on Python, see the [Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) or a 3rd party tutorial site like [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/).
