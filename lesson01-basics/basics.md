# Python for ATC Lesson 1: Basic Python

## Why Python?

- Easy to write compared to other languages
- Has good data science tools
- General purpose (versatile)

> We will use Python 3 not Python 2, because Python 2 is old and gross

## How do I use Python?

### Method 1 (Easiest):

Use repl.it - online interpreter so no installation required. Sign up and create a repl to start coding.

### Method 2:
Install [Python](python.org/downloads). Make sure to choose Python3. Running it will depend on your OS. If you check "ADD TO PATH" during installation, running it from command prompt / terminal will be a bit easier.

## Hello World :wave:
- Create a file called [hello_world.py](hello_world.py) (or anything ending in `.py`)
- Type in the following:

```
print('Hello World!')
```
- Run using your preferred method
- You should get the output:
```
Hello World!
```
